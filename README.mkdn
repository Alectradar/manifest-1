FlexOS
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/FlexOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/FlexMM/manifest.git -b mm6.0

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -f -jX

where X is the number of jobs.
